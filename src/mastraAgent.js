        Generate a complete, self-contained HTML file for a Tic-Tac-Toe game.
        It must include:
        - HTML structure: A 3x3 grid for the game board and a status display to show whose turn it is and the game result (win, draw).
        - CSS: Clean styling for the grid, cells, and status message. Cells should be clearly defined squares. 'X' and 'O' should be large and centered.
        - JavaScript:
            - Logic to handle player turns (X and O).
            - Click event listeners on the grid cells. A cell can only be marked once.
            - Logic to check for a win condition (rows, columns, diagonals) or a draw after every move.
            - A "Restart Game" button to clear the board and start a new game.
            - All JavaScript logic must be inside a single <script> tag.
        - Remember: The output must ONLY be the raw HTML content.

        prompt: `
        Generate a complete, self-contained HTML file for a simple stock portfolio tracking application.
        It must include:
        - HTML structure: An input form to add new stocks (ticker symbol, quantity, purchase price). A table to display the portfolio (Ticker, Quantity, Purchase Price, Current Price, Total Value, Gain/Loss). A summary section for total portfolio value.
        - CSS: A clean and readable layout for the form and table. Use alternating row colors for the table. Indicate gains in green and losses in red.
        - JavaScript:
            - An array to hold the portfolio data (use mock data for initial state).
            - Functionality to add a new stock from the form to the portfolio array and re-render the table.
            - A "Refresh Prices" button. When clicked, it should simulate fetching new prices by generating a random new price for each stock within +/- 10% of its purchase price.
            - Logic to calculate the current value, total value, and gain/loss for each stock and for the total portfolio.
            - All JavaScript logic must be inside a single <script> tag. Do not use any external APIs.
        - Remember: The output must ONLY be the raw HTML content.

        Generate a complete, self-contained HTML file for a web application that functions like a simplified drawing tool, similar to Excalidraw.
        It must include:
        - HTML structure: A main drawing canvas (<canvas> element) and buttons for tools (e.g., "Select", "Line", "Rectangle", "Circle", "Clear").
        - CSS: Basic styling for the layout, buttons, and canvas. The canvas should fill the available space.
        - JavaScript:
            - Use the HTML5 Canvas API for all drawing operations.
            - Implement drawing modes for lines, rectangles, and circles by clicking and dragging.
            - Show a preview of the shape as the user drags.
            - A "Clear Canvas" button that erases everything.
            - Store drawn shapes in an array so the canvas can be redrawn.
            - Basic "Select Tool" functionality: clicking a drawn shape should highlight it.
            - All JavaScript logic must be inside a single <script> tag.
        - Remember: The output must ONLY be the raw HTML content.
